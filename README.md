### Extensions/compatible programs ###
* [Wiki Utilities](https://github.com/Sidemen19/Wiki-Utilities) – an integration that allows wiki administrators to revert edits, block editors, and delete pages on the wiki by reacting to messages created by RcGcDw/RcGcDb. Author: [Sidemen19](https://github.com/Sidemen19)

### Alternatives ###
There are various alternatives to RcGcDw you may want to consider if for some reason RcGcDw doesn't satisfy your needs:
* [Wiki-Bot](https://wiki.wikibot.de/wiki/Wiki-Bot_Wiki) - while it's not exactly an alternative since Wiki-Bot is running a modified version of RcGcDw in the backend, you can use its rcscript feature to add a webhook for your wiki and have it work similarly to how RcGcDw does without hosting anything on your own,
* [Extension:Discord](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Discord) - MediaWiki extension to do the same thing,
* [Extension:DiscordNotifications](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:DiscordNotifications) - another MediaWiki extension with the same goal.
